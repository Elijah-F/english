# JSON Data Types

[Jump to webpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types:~:text=Data%20types,-%5B)

JSON's basic data types are:

- Number: a signed decimal number that may contain a fractional part and may use exponential E notation, but cannot include non-numbers such as NaN. The format makes no distinction between integer and floating-point. JavaScript uses a double-precision floating-point format for all its numeric values (until later also supports BigInt[25]), but other languages implementing JSON may encode numbers differently.

- String: a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters. Strings are delimited with double-quotation marks and support a backslash escaping syntax.

- Boolean: either of the values true or false

- Array: an ordered list of zero or more values, each of which may be of any type. Arrays use square bracket notation with comma-separated elements.

- Object: a collection of name–value pairs where the names (also called keys) are strings. Objects are intended to represent associative arrays,[2] where each key is unique within an object. Objects are delimited with curly brackets and use commas to separate each pair, while within each pair the colon ':' character separates the key or name from its value.

- null: an empty value, using the word null
